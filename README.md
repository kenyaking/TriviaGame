Challenge/Problem: Create a quiz game with a time limit for completion.

Solution: I created a trivia game application that gives players 80 seconds to answer six questions about television programs that aired during the 1980s. The player will read the questions and answer true or false. If the player gets more questions correct than incorrect, the player wins the game.

Technology: In addition to HTML/CSS, I used Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery.
